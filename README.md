This is the official repository containing codes for the paper: Leveraging dynamic bonds to probe equilibrium topology in polymer networks

The folder 'KMC' contains C++ codes for Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations for dynamic polymers. 

The folder 'Loop counting' contains codes used for analyzing cycle length distributions in networks, based on a previously published algorithm (https://journals.aps.org/prmaterials/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.9.015602)

The folder 'Depercolation' contains codes for calculating depercolation thresholds for networks used in this work.
